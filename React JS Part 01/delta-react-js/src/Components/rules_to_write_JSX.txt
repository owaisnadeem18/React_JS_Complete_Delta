There are three following rules to write JSX:  

1. We could not return more than one root element 

2. Closing all the tags is a must in JSX (because when JSX's code is converted by "Babble" into JS , then it is compulsory for Babble to have the tags which are having a cloing tag

3. camelCase most of the things
